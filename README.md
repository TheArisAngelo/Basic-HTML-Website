# Basic-HTML-Website

You are required to create a simple multi-page website using only HTML. The website must have four pages: a Homepage, a Projects page, an Articles page, and a Contact page. Each page should use semantic HTML structure, including elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer.

All pages must include a navigation bar that links to all four pages, and the navigation bar should appear consistently on every page. The content of each page should be appropriate to its purpose. For example, the homepage should welcome users, the projects page can describe example projects, the articles page can include short sample text about topics or blog posts, and the contact page should include a form.

The contact form must include fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button. You do not need to implement any form processing or back-end functionality.

Each HTML page must also include SEO-friendly meta tags inside the <head> section. These must include a UTF-8 character set declaration, a viewport meta tag for responsive design, a meta description relevant to the page, and a title tag.

You are not required to add any CSS or JavaScript. The focus of this project is on learning how to create and link multiple HTML pages, organize content using semantic tags, and prepare the website for future styling or functionality.

Before submitting your work, make sure you have four separate HTML files: index.html, projects.html, articles.html, and contact.html. Each should have the correct structure, include the navigation bar, have appropriate meta tags, and—on the contact page—include a working form.
